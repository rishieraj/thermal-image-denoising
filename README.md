# Denoising in Thermal Images

A PyTorch implementation for removing fixed pattern noise (FPN) in thermal images using a U-Net architecture. This repository provides a modular codebase for training and evaluating deep learning models to restore clean thermal imagery from noisy inputs. Includes configurable training pipelines, data loaders, and metrics (PSNR/SSIM) for benchmarking. Ideal for researchers and engineers working on infrared imaging, industrial inspection, or computational photography.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and setup

To setup the codebase, please run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/schowdhury671/meerkat.git

# Change to the root directory
cd thermal-denoising

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
